# WHY THIS PROJECT

 This was another tutorial I did thanks to the Net Ninja YouTube channel. The goal of this project was to further expand my knowledge
 of React. In this project, I learned how files correlate to one another, some benefits of using React, how to create hooks, how to use
 useEffect and useState, and overall syntax of JSX. 

 # NOTE

 If you find yourself lost on a page that doesn't exist, the art there was done by Coding Artist on YouTube. Had I done that myself, I would
 probably use Figma to create an image and then use css animations to make the image move. Coding Artist... you are unreal!
